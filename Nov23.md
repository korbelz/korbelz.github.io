# November Blog post

This month was the first month of having public updates for the Warlords IV: Core mission framework. I've never written a blog before so I'm still working on the formatting. 

Here is the full post that I made in the official discord

" Arma: Reforger released 1.0 today so its time to get started on development of Warlords IV for Arma 4.

I setup a little github page/blog so I can post information about the road to "Warlords IV: Core" framework release. 

TL;DR: Using Arma: Reforger as a crawl -- walk -- run style learning of Enfusion engine, then moving on to make  an open source framework that is easy for the community to setup as a standalone mission with default warlords features or mod if they choose to.

I still plan on working on/helping on all the various arma 3 warlords projects(mainly Open Warlords) at least 1 night a week until Arma 4 reaches public beta.

### Background on why I'm having a "staged" development cycle

First and most important is the enfusion engine is brand new. Each major patch is bringing new features and breaking old features. Having multiple smaller missions as a build up/training/testing means I won't be locked in to any bad/old/early ways of doing things in the final mission. 

Second: I'm learning. As I learn and getting better at using the game engine I can improve on each stage of mission since I'll be rewriting the systems each time. A great example of this is in arma 3 warlords carrier spawning. While I was working on Warlords2(Redux) I was brand new and tried a very noob way to spawn jets on carriers...lets just say it was bad, very bad and needed to get removed. Second mission I coded a carrier spawning system for was Warlords Redux: Miller edition, I was much safer and reliable way to spawn but was still a little janky because you needed to taxi up a ramp to get on the carrier. Third mission I added a carrier spawning system to was Open Warlords Redux'd, this was the first system that actually "worked" correctly and I was fairly happy with. Plus side was I also made the system modular and pretty efficient speedwise allowing me to copy/paste it quickly across other missions.  

Third: Feedback as I go. Early stages of a mission its actually fairly hard to get good feedback because barebone features. This can lead to getting locked into less than ideal design choices early in the project that require a lot of work to work around later in the project. Knowing I'm going to have multiple mini missions will allow me to collect feedback and lessons learned before any design choices are made at the start of Warlords IV: Core" 

### Next Month plans

Dec plans: I'm going to try to start streaming over on twitch in the afternoons(UTC) monday - thursday purely working on enfusion projects. Not all my work will be Warlords related because I really want to make sure I understand enfusion engine pretty well before I get too deep into Warlords. I'll flesh out the feature list on the main page of this site over the course of the month. I have a fully feature already written out I just need to transfer it all over to obsidian notes, get it all linked up, then copy and paste it over here to github so everyone can see it. 

see you over on twitch.tv/korbelz
